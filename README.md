# ðŸ”Š Amplify

Amplify attaches afterburners to your data. Amplify:

* **describes**: metadata detection and forwarding
* **augments**: derivative data generation like thumbnails, previews, etc. 
* **enriches**: batteries-included value-adds services like OCR, translation, transcription, etc.

Amplify leverages the decentralized compute provided by [Bacalhau](https://bacalhau.org) to magically enrich your data. A built-in suite of pipelines decides what your data is and how to best improve upon it. You can also self-host Amplify to trigger off your offline data sources and implement your own custom pipelines.
